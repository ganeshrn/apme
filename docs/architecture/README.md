# APME Architecture Pipeline

This directory documents **how APME works at runtime** — the processing
pipeline as a numbered sequence of stages, from CLI invocation through to
final output.

> **architecture/** vs **design/**: Architecture docs describe the runtime
> pipeline — what happens, in what order, and how data flows between
> services. Design docs (in `../design/`) explain **why** a subsystem was
> built the way it was — alternatives considered, trade-offs, and rationale.

The former monolithic `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `DATA_FLOW.md` have been
[archived](../archive/); their content is now covered by docs 00–17
below.
