# 13 — Gateway and Persistence

> Previous: [12 — CLI Output and Presentation](12-output-and-presentation.md) | Next: [14 — UI and WebSocket Integration](14-ui-integration.md)

## Purpose

The Gateway is the persistence and REST API layer for APME. It receives
scan/fix events from the engine via gRPC, stores them in SQLite, and
serves a read-oriented REST API for dashboards and the React UI. It also
bridges WebSocket connections from the browser to Primary's `FixSession`
gRPC stream, enabling the UI to run check/remediate operations directly.

## Architecture

The Gateway runs two servers concurrently from a single process:

```mermaid

    subgraph gateway [Gateway Process]
        direction TB
        GRPC["gRPC Reporting\n:50060"]
        HTTP["FastAPI + Uvicorn\n:8080"]
        DB[(SQLite)]
    end

    Engine -->|FixCompletedEvent| GRPC
    Engine -->|RegisterRules| GRPC
    GRPC -->|ORM rows| DB
    HTTP -->|read queries| DB
    UI["React SPA :8081"] -->|REST /api/v1/*| HTTP
    UI -->|WS /ws/session| HTTP
    UI -->|WS /projects/{id}/ws/operate| HTTP
    HTTP -->|gRPC FixSession| Engine
```

### Dual-Server Lifecycle

`src/apme_gateway/main.py` orchestrates both servers:

1. Initialize the SQLite database (`init_db`)
2. Launch gRPC Reporting server and FastAPI/Uvicorn HTTP server
   concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`
3. Wait for `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` via a shared `asyncio.Event`
4. Gracefully stop both servers and close the database

Configuration is environment-variable driven:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `APME_GATEWAY_GRPC_LISTEN` | `0.0.0.0:50060` | gRPC bind address |
| `APME_GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP bind port |
| `APME_DB_PATH` | `/data/apme.db` | SQLite database path |

## gRPC Reporting Servicer

`src/apme_gateway/grpc_reporting/servicer.py` — `ReportingServicer`
implements two RPCs defined in `proto/apme/v1/reporting.proto`:

### ReportFixCompleted

Receives a `FixCompletedEvent` from the engine after a scan/fix session
completes. Decomposes the event into ORM rows in a single transaction:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Event[FixCompletedEvent] --> Upsert[Upsert Session row]
    Upsert --> Scan[Create Scan row]
    Scan --> V[Add Violation rows]
    Scan --> P[Add Proposal rows]
    Scan --> L[Add ScanLog rows]
    Scan --> Pa[Add ScanPatch rows]
    Scan --> M[Add ScanManifest + collections + packages]
    Scan --> G[Add ScanGraph row]
    V & P & L & Pa & M & G --> Commit[db.commit]
```

Each child record is linked to the `Scan` via `scan_id`. Violations are
stored for both `remaining_violations` and `fixed_violations` from the
event. The manifest includes collection and Python package rows with
deduplication on FQCN.

### RegisterRules

Receives the full rule catalog from an authority Primary on startup.
Performs a full reconciliation against the existing catalog:

- **New rules** — inserted
- **Removed rules** — deleted (cascades to overrides)
- **Existing rules** — updated with latest metadata

Only accepted from pods with `is_authority=True`. Non-authority
registrations are logged and rejected.

## Database Schema

`src/apme_gateway/db/models.py` defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models using
`DeclarativeBase`. The schema is organized around two top-level entities:

### Entity Relationships

```
Project (ADR-037)           Session (CLI/playground)
   │                            │
   └──► Scan ◄──────────────────┘
         │
         ├── Violation[]
         ├── Proposal[]
         ├── ScanLog[]
         ├── ScanPatch[]
         ├── ScanManifest (1:1)
         │    ├── ScanCollection[]
         │    └── ScanPythonPackage[]
         ├── ScanGraph (1:1)
         └── (project_id nullable for CLI scans)

Rule (ADR-041)
   └── RuleOverride (1:1)

GalaxyServer (ADR-045)
```

### Key Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `projects` | SCM-backed project definitions (name, repo URL, branch, health score) |
| `sessions` | CLI session tracking by deterministic hash |
| `scans` | Individual check/remediate runs with summary counts |
| `violations` | Per-violation records (rule, severity, file, line, snippet) |
| `proposals` | AI proposal outcomes (approved/rejected/pending) |
| `scan_logs` | Structured pipeline log entries |
| `scan_patches` | Per-file unified diffs |
| `scan_manifests` | Dependency manifest metadata (ansible-core version, requirements) |
| `scan_collections` | Collection references per scan (FQCN, version, source, license) |
| `scan_python_packages` | Python package references per scan |
| `scan_graphs` | Serialized ContentGraph JSON |
| `rules` | Registered rule catalog from engine |
| `rule_overrides` | Admin-configured severity/enabled overrides |
| `galaxy_servers` | Global Galaxy/Automation Hub server definitions (ADR-045) |

All timestamps are stored as ISO 8601 strings. The database uses
aiosqlite for async access via SQLAlchemy's async session factory.

## REST API

`src/apme_gateway/api/router.py` defines the FastAPI router under
`/api/v1`. All read endpoints query the SQLite database; write operations
originate from the gRPC Reporting servicer (push model) or project CRUD.

### Health Probing

The `/health` endpoint probes all upstream services:

- **gRPC services** — uses the standard `grpc.health.v1.Health` check
  protocol; treats `UNIMPLEMENTED` as reachable
- **HTTP services** — GET to the base URL; any non-5xx response is OK
- **Database** — executes a simple count query

Returns an overall status of `"ok"` or `"degraded"`.

## WebSocket Endpoints

Two WebSocket endpoints bridge the browser to the engine:

### `/ws/session` — Playground

`session_client.py` handles the full lifecycle:

1. Client uploads files as base64 JSON messages
2. Gateway writes files to a temp directory
3. Gateway opens a `FixSession` gRPC stream to Primary
4. Bidirectional forwarding: gRPC events to WS JSON, WS commands to gRPC
5. Supports session resume via `?resume=<session_id>`

### `/projects/{id}/ws/operate` — Project Operations

The project WebSocket endpoint:

1. Client sends `{"action": "check"|"remediate", "options": {...}}`
2. Gateway clones the project's repo
3. Gateway drives `FixSession` via `run_project_operation()`
4. Streams progress, proposals, and results back to the client
5. After completion, links the scan to the project and updates health score

Both WebSocket handlers tolerate client disconnects — they continue
draining gRPC events so the Primary finishes normally and the Reporting
servicer receives the `FixCompletedEvent`.
