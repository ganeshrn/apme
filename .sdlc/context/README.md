# Context Documents

This directory contains **stable, project-wide knowledge** that applies across all features.

## Purpose

Context documents answer "How does our system work?" They provide:
- Architectural patterns and design decisions
- Coding conventions and standards
- System-wide rules and constraints
- Background knowledge for implementation

## When to Read

- **Always**: When onboarding to the project
- **Before any task**: To understand relevant patterns
- **When making decisions**: To ensure consistency

## When to Add New Documents

Add to `context/` when the content:
- Applies to multiple features or the whole project
- Won't change when individual features are completed
- Represents a stable convention or design decision

For feature-specific documentation, use `specs/` instead.
