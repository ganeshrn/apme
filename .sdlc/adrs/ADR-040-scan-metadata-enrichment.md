# ADR-040: Scan Metadata Enrichment

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-03-25

## Context

During a project scan, the engine discovers significant information about the project beyond violations: which Ansible collections are used (and their versions), which Python packages are in the session environment, what `requirements.yml` and `requirements.txt` contain, what ansible-core version was used, and how FQCNs resolved. The Galaxy Proxy also resolves the full transitive dependency tree when building session venvs.

Today, nearly all of this knowledge is discarded. The `FixCompletedEvent` primarily exposes violations and diagnostics (alongside scan/session identifiers, logs, and hierarchy payload), but does not carry any dependency or manifest metadata. The Gateway persists violations and computes health scores, but has no record of what collections or Python packages a project depends on.

This matters for two reasons:

1. **Consumers need project context, not just violations.** ADR-038 established the Gateway REST API as the public data-sharing interface. Consumers like Controller and CI/CD systems need to know *what* a project depends on — not just what's wrong with it. A pre-flight gate might ask "does this project use any collection with Critical findings?" Today the Gateway can't answer that question because it doesn't know what collections the project uses.

2. **Derivative analysis requires dependency data.** Collection health scanning (running collections through the engine), Python CVE checking (pip-audit / OSV), SBOM generation (DR-002), and drift detection all need a project's dependency manifest as input. Without persisted metadata, each of these tools would need to independently discover dependencies — duplicating work the engine already does.

### What the engine already knows

| Data | Source | Currently surfaced? |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Collections used (FQCN → collection) | M001-M004 resolution, L026 | Only as violation metadata |
| Collection versions | Session venv (`uv pip list`) | No |
| Python packages + versions | Session venv | No |
| Transitive collection deps | Galaxy Proxy resolution | No |
| `requirements.yml` contents | Project file parsing | No |
| `requirements.txt` / EE definition | Project file parsing | No |
| ansible-core version | Session venv build | Partially (session_id) |

The data exists. The contract doesn't carry it.

## Decision

**We will extend the scan reporting contract to include a project dependency manifest, persist it in the Gateway, and expose it via the REST API.**

### Manifest structure

The engine emits a `ProjectManifest` alongside violations in `FixCompletedEvent` (ADR-039):

```protobuf
message CollectionRef {
  string fqcn = 1;           // e.g. "community.general"
  string version = 2;        // e.g. "8.0.0"
  string source = 3;         // "specified", "learned", or "dependency"
  string license = 4;        // SPDX identifier or free-text (from MANIFEST.json / galaxy.yml)
  string supplier = 5;       // namespace (e.g. "community", "ansible"); from galaxy.yml namespace field
}

message PythonPackageRef {
  string name = 1;            // e.g. "jmespath" (PEP 503 normalized)
  string version = 2;         // e.g. "1.0.1"
  reserved 3;                 // was required_by (removed)
  string license = 4;         // from package METADATA
  string supplier = 5;        // from package METADATA Author field
}

message ProjectManifest {
  string ansible_core_version = 1;
  repeated CollectionRef collections = 2;
  repeated PythonPackageRef python_packages = 3;
  repeated string requirements_files = 4;   // paths found in project
  string dependency_tree = 5;               // raw `uv pip tree` output
}
```

**Note on roles:** Role inventory is deferred until the ContentGraph (ADR-044)
lands. The ContentGraph models roles as first-class graph nodes with metadata,
parent-child relationships, and quality attributes. Adding a flat `RoleRef` to
the manifest now would be superseded by the richer graph model. Once ADR-044
is implemented, role data flows naturally from the graph into the manifest.

### Data flow

```
Engine (check/remediate via FixSession)
  ├── resolves FQCNs → collections
  ├── enumerates session venv → packages
  └── emits FixCompletedEvent + ProjectManifest
        │
        ▼
Gateway (persist)
  ├── stores manifest in scan_manifests table
  ├── updates project ↔ collection associations
  └── exposes via REST API
        │
        ▼
Consumers (query)
  ├── GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/dependencies
  ├── GET /api/v1/collections (all known collections)
  └── GET /api/v1/collections/{fqcn}/projects (who uses this?)
```

### REST API extensions (planned, per ADR-038)

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/dependencies` | Collections and Python packages for a project |
| `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/sbom?format=cyclonedx` | SBOM in CycloneDX 1.5 JSON (serialized from manifest) |
| `GET /api/v1/collections` | All collections seen across projects, with usage counts |
| `GET /api/v1/collections/{fqcn}` | Collection detail: version, projects using it, health score |
| `GET /api/v1/collections/{fqcn}/projects` | Projects that depend on this collection |
| `GET /api/v1/python-packages` | All Python packages seen across projects, with usage counts |
| `GET /api/v1/python-packages/{name}` | Package detail: version(s), projects using it, CVE status |

### SBOM as a derivative view

SBOM generation (DR-002) is a presentation concern, not an engine concern. The
`ProjectManifest` carries the same data as an SBOM — collections, packages,
versions, licenses, suppliers — just in protobuf rather than CycloneDX or SPDX
format. The engine discovers and emits the data; the Gateway serializes it into
consumer formats.

CycloneDX, SPDX, CSV, or any future format is a serializer in the Gateway — a
function from persisted manifest data to a specific output shape. Adding a new
format means adding a Gateway serializer, not touching the engine. The engine
remains format-agnostic.

The `apme sbom` CLI subcommand calls the Gateway REST API to retrieve the
formatted output, establishing the pattern for CLI operations that consume
persisted data rather than orchestrating engine work directly (see ADR-024
future direction).

PURLs (Package URLs) are derived from manifest fields at serialization time:

| Component type | PURL pattern |
|----------------|-------------|
| Collection | `pkg:generic/{namespace}.{name}@{version}?repository_url=...` |
| Python package | `pkg:pypi/{pep503_name}@{version}` |
| Role | Deferred until ADR-044 (ContentGraph) provides the role model |

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Derive dependencies from violations only

**Description**: Infer collection usage from M001-M004 violation metadata (which already includes `resolved_fqcn`). No proto change needed.

**Pros**:
- No contract change
- Works today for collections that trigger violations

**Cons**:
- Only captures collections that have *problems*. A clean collection with no violations would be invisible.
- No Python package data
- No version information
- Fragile — depends on violation metadata structure

**Why not chosen**: Incomplete. A project using 10 collections where 2 have violations would only show 2 collections.

### Alternative 2: Gateway discovers dependencies independently

**Description**: Gateway parses `requirements.yml` and project files itself, bypassing the engine.

**Pros**:
- No engine changes
- Gateway controls the logic

**Cons**:
- Duplicates parsing that the engine already does
- Gateway doesn't have a session venv — can't resolve transitive deps or enumerate installed packages
- Galaxy Proxy resolution happens during engine session setup, not in the Gateway

**Why not chosen**: The engine already has the data. Duplicating discovery is wasteful and less accurate.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The Gateway gains a complete picture of project dependencies, enabling collection health correlation, SBOM generation, and drift detection.
- Derivative analysis tools (collection scanner, CVE checker) can query the Gateway API for input data instead of independently discovering dependencies.
- ADR-038's public API becomes significantly more useful — consumers can ask "what does this project depend on?" not just "what's wrong with it?"

### Negative

- Proto change requires regeneration and version coordination across engine and Gateway.
- `ProjectManifest` adds payload size to `FixCompletedEvent`. For large projects with many collections, this could be significant. Mitigation: manifest is per-scan, not per-violation.
- Gateway schema migration needed for new tables (collection refs, package refs, project associations).

### Neutral

- The engine's scan latency is unaffected — it already resolves this data during scanning. Emitting it is serialization cost only.
- The Galaxy Proxy is unchanged. It already resolves dependencies; the engine just surfaces what the proxy discovered.

## Implementation Notes

### Engine changes

The scan pipeline already enumerates the session venv (`list_installed_collections`,
`list_installed_packages`, `get_dependency_tree` in `venv_manager/session.py`),
captures the results in `SessionState` via `scan_fn`, and assembles a
`ProjectManifest` via `_build_manifest()` attached to `FixCompletedEvent`.

Remaining work:
1. Extend `list_installed_packages` — replace the `pip list` subprocess with
   `importlib.metadata` run in the venv's Python. One subprocess, returns
   name, version, license, and author in a single pass.
2. Extend `list_installed_collections` — after `ansible-galaxy collection list`
   returns `(fqcn, version)` pairs, walk the collection install paths to read
   `license` and `supplier` from each collection's `MANIFEST.json` /
   `galaxy.yml`. This is new filesystem access — the current function only
   parses the JSON output from `ansible-galaxy`.
3. Update `_build_manifest` to populate the new `license`/`supplier` proto fields.

### Gateway changes

1. New DB tables: `scan_manifests`, `scan_collections`, `scan_python_packages` (scan-scoped; project views derived from latest scan).
2. `grpc_reporting/servicer.py`: Extract and persist manifest from `FixCompletedEvent`.
3. New REST endpoints under `/api/v1/`.
4. SBOM serializer(s) — CycloneDX 1.5 JSON initially, additional formats (SPDX, CSV) as needed. Serializers live in the Gateway, not the engine.

### Implementation PRs

**PR 1: Engine + Proto — hydrate `ProjectManifest`.**
Extend `CollectionRef` and `PythonPackageRef` with `license` and `supplier`
proto fields. The collection and package enumeration pipeline already exists
(`list_installed_collections`, `list_installed_packages` → `SessionState` →
`_build_manifest` → `FixCompletedEvent`). This PR extends the existing
functions to also extract license/supplier: replace `pip list` with
`importlib.metadata` for packages, read `MANIFEST.json`/`galaxy.yml` for
collections. No new collectors needed. No roles — deferred to ADR-044.

**PR 2: Gateway — DB schema + persistence + SBOM endpoint.**
New tables for manifest data. `ReportingServicer` extracts and persists
the manifest. `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/sbom?format=cyclonedx` with
CycloneDX serializer. `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/dependencies` for raw
manifest data.

**PR 3: CLI — `apme sbom` via Gateway REST.**
The CLI calls the Gateway REST API to retrieve formatted SBOM output.
First CLI subcommand that uses REST instead of gRPC, establishing the
pattern for read-heavy operations on persisted data (see ADR-024 future
direction).

### Galaxy Proxy (no changes)

The proxy already resolves transitive dependencies. The engine reads the installed result from the session venv.

- ADR-024: Thin CLI — future direction for CLI → Gateway REST migration; `apme sbom` is the first case
- ADR-044: Node Identity / ContentGraph — role inventory deferred until the graph model is available
