  Create an Architecture Decision Record. Use when documenting an

  after resolving an architectural DR. Do NOT use for capturing questions
  (use dr-new instead) or reviewing existing ADRs (use sdlc-status instead).

# ADR New

Create an Architecture Decision Record.

## Arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, parse for:
- Decision title in quotes → use as ADR title
- `--from-dr DR-NNN` → pre-fill from a decided DR
- `--status X` → set status (proposed/accepted)

## Usage

```
/adr-new                            # Interactive mode
/adr-new "Decision Title"           # Quick mode with title
/adr-new --from-dr DR-008           # Pre-fill from decided DR
/adr-new "Title" --status accepted  # With status
```

## Behavior

### 1. Check for Context

**From DR:** If `--from-dr DR-NNN` provided, read the DR and pre-populate:
- Context from DR context
- Options from DR options
- Decision from DR decision
- Rationale from DR rationale

Ask user to confirm or modify.

**From conversation:** If recent discussion contains a decision:
```
I see you decided [X] over [Y]. Create ADR from this? (Y/n)
```

### 2. Determine Next ADR Number

Scan `.sdlc/adrs/ADR-*.md` for highest number, increment by 1.

### 3. Gather Information (Streamlined)

```
Decision title?
```

```
Context — why is this decision needed?
```
Accept paragraph. Will include any constraints and drivers mentioned.

```
Constraints and drivers? (bullet list, or included above)
```
Accept freeform bullets. Parse into constraints and decision drivers.

```
Options considered (name: description, pros/cons):
```
Accept freeform. For each option, parse:
- Name and description
- Pros (lines starting with +)
- Cons (lines starting with -)

Require at least 2 options for meaningful comparison.

```
Decision — which option and why?
```
Accept option name/number and rationale together.

```
Consequences? (use +/- prefix, or describe)
```
Parse into:
- Positive (+ prefix)
- Negative (- prefix)
- Neutral (~ prefix or unmarked)

```
Status? (1=Proposed, 2=Accepted)
```

```
Implementation guidance? (or skip)
```

```
Related ADRs? (numbers, or skip)
```
Validate ADRs exist, include titles.

```
From a DR? (number, or skip)
```
If provided, link ADR to DR and update DR with ADR reference.

### 4. Create ADR File

Create `.sdlc/adrs/ADR-NNN-title-slug.md` using template.

**Slug:** 3-5 words, lowercase, hyphens.

Fill:
- Title, Status, Date (today)
- Context (including constraints/drivers)
- Options with pros/cons
- Decision and rationale
- "Why not chosen" for rejected options
- Consequences (positive/negative/neutral)
- Implementation notes (if provided)
- Related decisions
- References (originating DR if applicable)
- Revision history with initial entry

### 5. Update Index

Edit `.sdlc/adrs/README.md`:
- Add row: `| [ADR-NNN](ADR-NNN-slug.md) | Title | Status | YYYY-MM |`
- Insert in numerical order
- Add to Changelog table

### 6. Link to DR (if applicable)

If ADR originated from a DR:
- Update DR's "Related Artifacts" to reference ADR
- If DR open, note that ADR captures the decision

### 7. Summary

```
Done!
- Created: ADR-NNN-title-slug.md
- Status: [Proposed/Accepted]
- Updated: adrs/README.md

Next: [If Proposed] Share for review | [If Accepted] Implement
```

## Quick Mode

With inline parameters:

| Provided | Skip |
|----------|------|
| Title in quotes | Title prompt |
| `--status X` | Status prompt |
| `--from-dr DR-NNN` | Context, options, decision prompts |

## From-DR Mode

With `--from-dr DR-NNN`:
1. Read the decided DR
2. Extract context, options, decision, rationale
3. Show summary and ask for confirmation
4. User can modify or accept
5. Automatically link ADR ↔ DR

## Parsing Freeform Options

Accept variations:
```
Redis: In-memory cache with TTL
+ Fast, built-in expiration
- Extra container

Memcached: Distributed cache
+ Simple, lightweight
- No persistence
```

Or structured:
```
Option 1: Redis
Pros: Fast, TTL support
Cons: Extra container
```

Parse into standard format for ADR.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| <2 options provided | Ask for at least one more |
| DR not found | Warn and continue without pre-fill |
| DR not decided | Warn that DR is still open |
| No consequences listed | Note "To be determined" |
